## Setting up Virtual Environments on Hipergator
* The basics about how to __manage environments__ via Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#).

### Initial Setup (Only Needed for the First Time)
* Log in to Hipergator with your account.
* Download and install `Miniconda` to your home directory using the following commands:
  
  `cd ~`

  `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`

  `chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`

  `./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`


### Set up Virtual Environments via Conda on Hipergator
* To create an environment: `conda create --name myenv`.
  * Please note: this command will install the environment to your __home directory__.
  * Personally, I recommend installing environments to Blue Storage as the home directory has very limited storage.
* Specifying a location for an environment: `conda create --prefix env_loc`
* Activate environment: `conda activate env_name` or `conda activate env_loc`
* Installing packages to the environment: use `conda` or `pip` to install packages to your environment
* Deactivate environment: `conda deactivate`

For setting up virtual environments with specific versions of packages, please consult [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
