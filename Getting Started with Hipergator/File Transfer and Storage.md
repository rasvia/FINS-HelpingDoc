## File Transfer and Storage

### [Storage](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Storage)
* Home storage:
    * Your home directory is the first directory you see when you log into HiPerGator. It's always found at `~`, `/home/$USER`, or `$HOME` paths.
    * Home Directory contains files important for setting up user shell environment and secure shell connections.
    * __Do not remove any .bash* files or the .ssh directory, or you will have problems using your HiPerGator account.__
* Blue Storage
* Orange Storage

### [File Transfer](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Transfer_Data)
* Personally, I would recommand using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) for transferring files to hipergator.
* You can also map the storage to your computer and access files from the mapped drive.
