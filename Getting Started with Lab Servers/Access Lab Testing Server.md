## Getting Access to Lab Testing Server
Our lab has three small servers with 1 GPU each for small jobs or test runs, just in case Hipergator is in maintenance.

To access the servers, you can ssh to the server with the following commands:
* To access server 1: `ssh login@ece-woodard-vlnxgpu1.ad.ufl.edu`
* To access server 2: `ssh login@ece-woodard-2vlnxgpu.ad.ufl.edu`
* To access server 3: `ssh login@ece-woodard-3vlnxgpu.ad.ufl.edu`
