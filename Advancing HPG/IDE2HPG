* Hipergator provides remote usage of VSCode for coding development, please check the link for more details.
* The general step of using VScode is listed below:
  * After logging into Hipergator via ssh, submit a Interactive Session request using command `srun` (example - `srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=2gb -t 90 --pty bash -i`)
  * After resources have been allocated on hipergator, use commands `module load vscode` and `code tunnel` in terminal. Following the instruction coming up.
  * You can open online-version of VSCode built in HPG, or use local VSCode on your computer to connect to the node for code development.
  * To use local VSCode, after tunnel being activated, login to GitHub or Microsoft account.
